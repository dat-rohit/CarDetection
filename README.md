# Car-detection-app

Using the YOLO model, this app was built with the intent of detecting cars on a given image through an user interface and output the bounding box of the object.
This was built during the 2022 HiParis Hackaton.

## Installation

Install the needed packages listed in requirements.txt easily with:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Once in the ```Project``` folder, run the app with:

```bash
$ streamlit run single_image_detection.py
```

The app should then be accessible at ```http://localhost:8501```

The web interface built using Streamlit allows you to upload an image and detect if any car is present.
